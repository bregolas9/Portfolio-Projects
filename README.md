# Portfolio-Projects

My name is Brendan Bordine, and these are some projects I have done over the last three years. Although I feel all my projects are important there are a few that I would like to highlight. 

The first project is my project labeled "Intro to Databases". This was the first time using both JavaScript and SQL as languages. It is an Express app with the frontend being in JavaScript and the backend being in SQL. Learning the relationship between a database and how it is used was a key piece of my education. I now know how to make queries to a database and then put the data returned to me from those queries in functions or display it in a webpage or other type of application. I also learned how to edit/create SQL databases. 

The second project I would like to highlight is the one labeled "Web Development". In this project I created a React app using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. The app keeps track of exercise. The database that it uses is MongoDB. This was the first time I had ever used a REST API, and it went great. I was able to connect to MongoDB through GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE functions. Learning how to connect and use an API was a pillar in learning how to write applications. Once I learned how to do it for this project I was able to continue to do it through other APIs in different projects, such as the "Software Engineering 1" project. 

The third project I would like to highlight is the one labeled "Operating Systems 1". This project was by far the hardest project that I have done. Going into this project I knew very little C, and had no idea where to start. However, over the four weeks that I was given to do the project I taught myself C and completed the project successfully. The project is a small shell called "smallsh," which lets the user do a few things. The user is able to input commands such as '$$', '$?', and '$!' which have the same functionality as a bash shell would have. It also allows the user to use '~' in the same way. The program implements two shell built-in commands which are exit and cd. It also implements non-built in commands such as redirection operators '<' and '>', and the '&' operator to run commands in the background. The program also implements custom behavior for SIGSTP and SIGINT as I did not want SIGSTP to halt a process so instead it is simply ignored. SIGINT is also ignored in the same manner, except when the program is reading a line of input. SIGINT during this time is set to a signal handler which does nothing. This way instead of stopping the process it just reprints the prompt. 

My final highlighted project is my project labeled "text_based_adventure_game". The project is fully written in Python and was my capstone project. It is an interactive murder mystery game which utilizes an in-depth language system in order for the user to input anything they want and have the program respond. This project is my favorite. It was my first time writing any sort of game, and I had a lot to learn from the start. Thankfully, I was in a group with another person who had written games before and they helped me learn everything they knew about creating a game. The two of us had ten weeks to create a game with 15 rooms, over 30 items, and at least 15 ways to interact with the game. In the end we had met all of those specifications, and in some cases exceeded far beyond what was asked. The language system, as previously mentioned, is very in depth. The user can input any word into the game, and the game will either figure out what the user is trying to do, or it will return a short error message explaining that it does not understand the input it was given. This was my most successful group project, as both myself and the other person worked seamlessly. We met weekly in order to check-in and help each other if needed. We worked faster than our sprint plans, which lead to us having free time to be more creative and turn in a cleaner project. I learned a lot from this project, but my key takeaway would be learning how to write unit tests for something that is not a mathematical function. The project has 100% test coverage.
